# one-dimensional-pong
 the title is pretty explanitory, this is pong the classic game but 1 dimensional.
 to make it a fun functional game i added some more mechanics that were not in the original, like a hp system and respawning 

 this project originaly was taught of by my father when i was thinking of small code projects for in the summer, i further expanded on the idea and made it a fully    functional game

 ## controls
  in the start menu press SPACE to start the game 
 
  use A and D to move left and right respectivly 
  use P to pause the game

 ## suggestions 
  if you have any suggestions leave them in a isssue an i will try to make them
